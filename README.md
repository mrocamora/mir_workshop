### Introduction to Music Information Retrieval

This repository is part of the materials used in a workshop held in the context of the [SBCM 2021](https://compmus.org.br/2021/) that provides a brief overview of the field of [Music Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) (MIR), the interdisciplinary science of retrieving information from music.


The workshop covers some selected topics in MIR, such as audio similarity, pitch tracking, and rhythm analysis. The signal processing and machine learning techniques involved are discussed in an approachable way through a set of lectures and interactive lab sessions.

The workshop is designed for students, musicians, engineers, researchers, and data scientists who are new to MIR and want to get introduced to the field. Knowledge of basic digital audio principles and some experience with any programming language is recommended.

 
#### The notebooks


The notebook are intended for addressing some traditional MIR tasks. The fundamentals of the techniques are discussed during the workshop lectures. Please refer to the [Fundamentals of Music Processing (FMP)](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller/bookFMP) book for a great introduction to some essential topics in MIR. 

These notebooks are based on the [FMP notebooks](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP) that are an extension of the book.
